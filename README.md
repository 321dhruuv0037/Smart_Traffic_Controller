# Traffic Situation Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for classifying traffic situations into four categories: "high," "low," "heavy," and "normal." The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various features such as vehicle counts, time, and day of the week to classify the current traffic situation. The goal is to enhance traffic management systems by providing real-time insights into traffic conditions and optimizing signal control to improve transportation efficiency in urban areas.

## Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:
1. Open the `Smart_Traffic_Controller.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Analyze the results and model predictions within the notebook to gain insights into traffic situations and model accuracy.

## Dependencies
Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is included as a CSV file (`Traffic.csv` & `TrafficTwoMonth.csv`). It contains information collected by a computer vision model, including vehicle counts for cars, bikes, buses, and trucks, along with timestamps, dates, and days of the week. Additionally, the dataset includes a column indicating the traffic situation categorized into four classes: 1-Heavy, 2-High, 3-Normal, and 4-Low.
